// These are the fixed sets of values a job can have.
//
// We write them ONCE here and use them in two places:
//   1. In the Mongoose schema, as the list of allowed values (runtime check)
//   2. As TypeScript types, so the compiler catches typos (compile-time check)
//
// `as const` is what makes that possible. Without it, TypeScript would see
// this as a plain `string[]`. With it, TypeScript remembers the exact values.
